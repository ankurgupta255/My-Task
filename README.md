This is the repository for my task.

Postman Dump for the routes: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/ad41663cfab1c5f34f43 

I made the Back-End using NodeJS and ExpressJS, Front-End using ReactJS and React-Bootstrap, and Database used is MongoDB.

Folder structure:

* client: The ReactJS app for the Front-End

    * src/components: This contains all the pages for the Front-End (3 in this case).

    * src/containers: Contains the app.js file which uses react-router-dom for the routing.

* models: The MongoDB models

* public/profilePhotos: The storage of pictures

* routes: The route file exists here
